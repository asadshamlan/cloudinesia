As a Tech-Enthusiast, I am making an effort to write about Cloud and Tech. Contents had been moving around different platforms. Making this one of the learning medium for me. 

Starting with wordpress.com to hosted version of Wordpress (wordpress.org) on a local host facilities, 
to a managed WP image from bitnami in AWS Lightsail,
moving on to Static Site Generator using Jekyll,
to Github Pages (Still using Jekyll),
and now marry Jekyll, GitHub Pages, and FORESTRY, a git-based CMS.

Who knows where the tech takes me and my contents.
